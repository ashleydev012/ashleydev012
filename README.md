- 👋 Hi, I’m @ashleydev012
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Data Visualization and Machine Learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TReinforcement Learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting AI projects, building dashboard or solving Kaggle challenges =D
⚡ Fun fact: I'm totally in my element when I’ve got music playing, paint on my hands, and something sweet baking in the oven. 🎨🍪🎶
